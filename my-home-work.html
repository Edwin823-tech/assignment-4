    <h1> Travelling in Depression</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 34px;">
        When I was very little,I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home
        in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning
        experience.
        At five,I marveled at the Eiffe Tower in the City of Loghts. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Poazza
        San Marco <br> feeding hordes of pigeons,then glided down venetian wateerways on sleek gondolas, At thirteen,I
        saw
        the ancient,<br> megalithic structure of stonehenge and walked along the great wall of China, amazed that the
        thousand-year-old <br> stone were still in place.

        <br> It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.

            It begain with french, which taught me the importance of pronounciation.I remember once asking a store owner
            in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was.But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more
            accent on the A,she loolked at me bewildered.In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware
            of its similarities with English through cognates.Baseball in Spanish, for example,is beisbol, which looks
            different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible as it made speech and comprehension more fluid,
            and even today I find the cognates come to the rescue when I forget how say something in Spanish.
            Then in High school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled
            how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were
            combining simpler characters,so Huo () meaning fire and shan () meaning mountain can be joined to create
            Houshan (), which mans volcano. I love spenfing hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the
            beauty and rhythm as I form them.
